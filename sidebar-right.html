					<h1 class="page-title">CHILDHOOD</h1>
				</header>
				<blockquote>This is a very old photo of me and my brother.At that time I was very young and my family was very poor.This photo was taken at the gate of my house.Behind this door is my yard where I grew up.I spent my childhood here with joy.My parents were very clever.When I was six years old,they knew that my brother and I would not have a good future in such a poor mountain,so they took us away from here and went to town.They do business in the city with the help of their friends.Our brothers are in a better elementary school than their home school until I graduate from junior high school.</blockquote>

					<h1 class="page-title">HIGH SCHOOL AGE</h1>
				</header>
				<blockquote>After I finished my junior high school,I thought that the school conditions in the town were too bad.So I decided to leave here alone to study in the No.1 Middle School in Pingliang City.This photo was taken in the classroom when I was playing with my classmates in the front row.There, many of my good friends have made close contact so far. Here,I studied and lived alone.Finally, with my unremitting efforts, I took a very good university--Beijing University of Technology.If someone asks me to say the most regrettable decision in this life,then I think what I said will definitely be the choice of the first middle school in Pingliang.</blockquote>

					<h1 class="page-title">WITH MOM & BROTHER</h1>
				</header>
				<blockquote>This photo was taken during the summer vacation when I graduated from high school. At that time, my parents came with me to the city. My family bought a new house and I was admitted to university. Two happy things happen at the same time. My parents are particularly happy. So my mom made a reservation for the photographer and took a family portrait for my family,and this picture is one of them. My mother sitting in the middle with bright smile,My brother and I are sitting on both sides of her.</blockquote>
				<header class="page-header">
					<h1 class="page-title">COLLEGE LIFE</h1>
				</header>
				<blockquote>In fact, I started living alone since I was in high school. During my college days, I was far away from home. So from time to time I miss of my families and I often struggle with loneliness. Likewise, I also learned a lot from university and made some friends. This photo was taken at Renmin University of China. That day, I went there to participate in the activities of  Xinhua Compassion Education Foundation. Acturally I was funded by this foundation when I was in high school. I am very grateful for the material support it brings me.</blockquote>

					<h1 class="page-title">TOURISM IN HANGZHO</h1>
				</header>
				<blockquote>In the Golden Week of National Day in 2016, I chose to go to Hangzhou for travel because some of my best high school classmates are in college near Hangzhou so we can play together. The day I arrived in Hangzhou was met by CuiQi. He took me to Hangzhou's famous New White Deer for dinner. This photo was taken on the dinner board. Looking back now, those delicious meals are still enough to make me drool. I have the deepest reflection of Dongpo meat. During the few days in Hangzhou, we had a good meal and enjoyed the fun. We also watched the movie Mekong that was very hot at that time. Recalling Jiangnan, the most memory is Hangzhou!</blockquote>
				<header class="page-header">
					<h1 class="page-title">NOW</h1>
				</header>
				<blockquote>Now I am about to graduate from college and I want to continue my studies. Unfortunately,during my college years, my grades were not very good,so now I am under great pressure. Can I still continue at this school after one year? What kind of person and what kind of thing do I meet? Who knows!Just go for it!</blockquote>
